# Self-Supervised and Transfer Learning, Object Detection

This project is divided into two parts, both focusing on different aspects of machine learning using PyTorch.

### Part 1: Self-Supervised Learning by Rotation Prediction on CIFAR10

In this part, a model is trained on a self-supervised task using the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of small (32x32) images belonging to 10 different object classes. The model architecture used is ResNet18.

The self-supervised training task is image rotation prediction. All training images are randomly rotated by 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. The network is then trained to classify the rotation of each input image using cross-entropy loss. This task is treated as pre-training, and the pre-trained weights are then fine-tuned on the supervised CIFAR10 classification task.

Tasks completed include:
- Training a ResNet18 on the Rotation task.
- Fine-tuning only the weights of the final block of convolutional layers and linear layer on the supervised CIFAR10 classification task.
- Training the full network on the supervised CIFAR10 classification task.

### Part 2: YOLO Object Detection on PASCAL VOC

In this part of the project, an object detection model based on YOLOv1 (You Only Look Once version 1) is implemented and trained on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset¹.

YOLOv1 is a single-stage object detection model that frames object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities³. Unlike two-stage detectors, which require multiple feature extraction steps, YOLOv1 extracts features from images with a convolutional neural network only once⁴. This makes YOLOv1 significantly faster than two-stage detectors, though at the cost of lower accuracy².

The main tasks completed in this part of the project include:

1. **Implementing the YOLO loss function**: The YOLO loss function is a key component of the YOLOv1 model. It is responsible for calculating the difference between the predicted bounding boxes and class probabilities and the ground truth. The loss function guides the model during the training process to adjust its parameters and improve its predictions.

2. **Training the model**: The YOLOv1 model is trained on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, a widely used dataset for object detection tasks. The goal is to achieve a mean Average Precision (mAP) close to 0.5 after 50 epochs of training. The mAP is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of object detection models.
